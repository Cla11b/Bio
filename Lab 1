## Interest in the Course
I am interested in learning programming for R statistical software so that I can conduct research on citizen engagement and data-driven management in government and non-profit organizations. I want to build my understanding of using statistics to explore causal relationships and explanations to social phenomenon. I am looking forward to the learning-by-doing format of this course which will aid me in my pursuit of building a strong educational foundation in quantitative reasoning.
